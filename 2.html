	<p id="first">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. HTML describes the structure of a Web page.  It consists of a series of elements that tell the browser how to display the content. HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.</p>
	<p id="second">A simple text editor is all you need to learn HTML. Web pages can be created and modified by using professional HTML editors. However, for learning HTML  a simple text editor like Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac) is recommended. Using a simple text editor is a good way to learn HTML.</p>
	<p id="third">HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. All HTML elements can have attributes. Attributes provide additional information about elements. Attributes are always specified in the start tag. Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like:name="value"</p>
	<p id="fourth">All HTML documents must start with a document type eclaration: &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;. The HTML document itself begins with &lt;html&gt; and ends with &lt;/html&gt;. The visible part of the HTML document is between &lt;body&gt; and &lt;/body&gt;. The &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly. It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).The &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; declaration is not case sensitive. The &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; declaration for HTML5 is:&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;. 
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag. For example:  &lt;tagname&gt;Content goes here...&lt;/tagname&gt;</p>
